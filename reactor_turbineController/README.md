## About:
It was made to use with the Reactor and Turbine. The goal is to make the script fully control both structures, aiming max energy production and fuel efficiency.

## Compatibility:
- Bigger Reactors only

## TODO:
- Finish the drawGUIReactor function, more details on the function.
- Create the drawGUIControls logic, more details on the function.
- Make the logic that adjusts the turbine to generate the maximum energy possible in the most economical way.
- Make the logic that controls individually all the rods of the reactor according to the needs of the turbine.
