The code wait 2 seconds until running again.

Send a redstone pulse on the side defined in "sideOutput", if the drawer is empyt, or 
the quantity is greated them the "maxItems", or
the time reach 20 thats is defined in "maxTimer".

By default, the script calculates the max amount of items, but you can change the value on "maxItems" and the script gonna respect the new custom value.

Feel free to edit the code according to your needs. 

## Compatibility:
